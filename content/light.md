Light is our window, not only to the distant Universe, but to the entire world around us. *How Light Travels* is an enquiry-based activity in which students explore how light behaves, using common items such as torches, mirrors and a mixture of opaque, translucent and transparent objects. Specifically the class will learn that light moves in straight lines and can be reflected, and that effect of transparent and opaque objects on light.

##### Background Information

Light travels in **straight lines**. When light hits an object, it is **reflected** and enters our eyes, this is how we see the object.

When you think of reflection, it is likely that you think about mirrors. Mirrors reflect all of the light that hits them. That is the reason you can see yourself so clearly in a mirror. 

All objects we see either emit or reflect light, this is how we see them. For example, the ocean reflects light, although not as much of it as a mirror. If look down into the ocean, you will not see a clear reflection of yourself, but you will see a reflection of the sky. When light bounces off an object, **the angle of reflection is equal to the angle of incidence**.

**Transparent** objects allow you to see clearly through them; some examples are windows and glasses. **Translucent** objects only let some light through them so you cannot see clearly through a translucent object; some examples are plastic bottles and moving water. **Opaque** objects do not let any light through them s you cannot see through them; some examples of opaque objects are walls and tables.
