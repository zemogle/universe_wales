Universe in the Classroom offers a variety of astronomy educational resources and materials to support primary school teachers in their classroom. The resources include two activity books filled with a variety of demonstrations, hands-on activities, scientific investigations, games and worksheets. Cosmos in your Pocket and Telescope in your Pocket are two small booklets for children, filled with a range of engaging and fun astronomy education games.

Additionally, we have designed a model of a robotic telescope that can be printed and built by young children so that can own their very own 1-metre telescope.  Finally, the beautifully illustrated comic book ‘There’s No Such Thing As A Stupid Queston” is available to download and print. This excellent piece of artwork teaches children and adults alike that curiosity is a value to be cherished not dampened.

To help bring the subject into the classroom we have linked these activities to subjects in the curriculum such as Science, ICT, English, Welsh, Maths and Art, with an emphasis on Numeracy and Literacy.
