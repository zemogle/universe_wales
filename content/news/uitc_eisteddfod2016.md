We were very pleased to be invited to attend by this year's the National Eisteddfod by the [National Science Academy (NSA)](http://gov.wales/topics/science-and-technology/science/national-science-academy/?lang=en). We hosted a range of exciting and interactive Universe in the Classroom astronomy activities in the Science and Technology pavilion on 4th August.

The National Eisteddfod is a celebration of Welsh culture and language that takes place during the first week of August every year. The festival showcases science, music, visual arts, literature and much more, bringing together people of all ages and backgrounds from across Wales.

The Eisteddfod provided us with an excellent opportunity to present science to people of all ages, and to inspire children and young people to consider a career in the field, to study science and technology or to simply get curious about the world around them, specifically through the medium of welsh.

Our younger audiences thoroughly enjoyed the chance to explore the Solar System and constellations with our [Universe in a Box](/universe-in-a-box/) constellation viewer and model planets, whilst others learned about robotic telescopes with our free [Telescope in your Pocket](/print-resources/) booklets. 

Other activities included [Black Hole Hunter](http://www.blackholehunter.org/), a computer game designed by the Gravitational Waves group from Cardiff University School of Physics and Astronomy. This proved very popular with adults and children alike, allowing them the weird and wonderful opportunity to listen to the sounds of the Universe as they searched for gravitational waves.
