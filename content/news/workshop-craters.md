Since the 1500s people have been looking at the stars through telescopes, but what are they actually looking at and why bother? In the first school Universe in the Classroom workshop of the academic year, Mathematician and STEM role model Tara Hussein invited Year 4 students from Nant-y-Parc primary school in Caerphilly to learn about the Las Cumbres Observatory (LCO) and their research into asteroids.

Astronomers use telescopes to answer all kinds of questions, from the fairly simple “how far away is the nearest star?” to “how did the Universe come to be?” Their aim is to further our understanding of the world around us, and also to keep us safe. Whether its from dangerous cancer-causing cosmic rays or asteroid impactors that could wipe out life on Earth. The later is one of the areas of research carried out by our partners at LCO.

Las Cumbres Observatory runs a network of powerful robotic telescopes located around the world. Using the Internet, primary school students can control the telescopes and observe the hidden gems of the Universe using our specially designed, easy-to-use interface. But researchers also use these telescopes, and one thing they study are asteroids; how we find them, why we look for them, what happens when they impact with a moon or planet and the information we can gain from these impacts.

During the workshop, students learned that to find asteroids we must stack a series of observations to create a flipbook-effect, allowing us to see these rapidly moving objects cross the sky. To test their observational skills, students were asked to spot the asteroid in a series of images. 

Students then discovered the result of an asteroid impact, by making their own craters using flour layered with cocoa power and then following up with an online impact simulator called Down2Earth.

But what can we learn from the resulting craters? The year 4 students learned that we can actually calculate the age of a cosmic object, such as a planet or moon, but counting the number of craters on its surface. If we multiply the number of craters by the amount of time if takes for a crater to form on a body, we will find an estimate of its age. 

This is a technique employed by real scientists and one that can be practiced by school children. We used the crater counting method to calculate the age of the Moon, Mercury, Pluto and its moon, Charon.

We finished the workshop with a fun game of Astronomy Bingo, during which students discovered some of the other objects that can be studied with telescopes: star clusters, nebulae and galaxies. The winning students were invited to use the robotic telescopes to observe some of these objects, including this stunning image of a nebula called M17!
