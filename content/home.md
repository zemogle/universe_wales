**Universe in the Classroom is reaching out to primary schools and communities across Wales, hoping to spark a curiosity about the Universe and a passion for learning in young children.**

*Universe in the Classroom* is an initiative that provides improved teaching methods and innovative tools to modernise and enhance the way STEMM subjects (science, technology, engineering, medicine and mathematics) are taught in welsh primary schools. 

As well as inspirational school workshops, the programme offers free STEMM teacher training to ensure teachers have the confidence and knowledge to put the new resources to use in their classrooms. Our resources include [Robotic Telescopes](/robotic-telescope-for-wales/), [Universe-in-a-Box](/universe-in-a-box/) educatitonal toolkits, dozens of enquiry-based learning [activities](/activities/) and a host of [print materials](/print-resources/). 

Make the most of this amazing opportunity by joining Universe in the Classroom and contact us at: [robertsS38@cardiff.ac.uk](mailto:robertsS38@cardiff.ac.uk)
