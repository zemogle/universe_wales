Schools involved in *Universe in the Classroom* are being offered a unique and exciting opportunity — to explore the exotic wonders of the Universe from their classrooms using professional telescopes!

[Las Cumbres Observatory](http://lcogt.net) runs a network of powerful robotic telescopes located around the world. Using the Internet, primary school teachers and students can control the telescopes and observe the hidden gems of the Universe using our specially designed, easy-to-use interface. Users don't need any prior knowledge of telescopes or astronomical objects, we provide everything you need to become an explorer of the skies.

## Supporting Materials

 A core aspect of *Universe in the Classroom* is to help Welsh students (and their teachers) enjoy and explore the vast Universe using this robotic telescope network. A range of astronomy activities, guides and screencasts have been designed to support use of the robotic telescopes.

#### Robotic Telescopes Activity Book

 The robotic telescopes activity book allows students to pursue their own science investigations using professional-quality equipment and cover a range of National Curriculum subjects to help teachers fit the activities and telescopes into their lesson plans.

#### How-to Guides

We have created two simple step-by-step guide: the first walks users through their first observing session and the second shows you how to download and add colour to your images.

#### Screencasts 

To make using the telescopes as simple as possible we have created a series of screencasts. The first instalment will walk you through how to observe with the telescopes and the second shows you how to add colour to your pictures of space. You can watch both of these videos below, or find them on Youtube using the links provided.

#### SEROL

The robot behind Las Cumbres Observatory is called SEROL ("Starry" in Welsh). SEROL controls the telescopes, you simply tell it what you'd like to observe and he will do all the hard work for you. This character appears throughout all of the Universe in the Classroom resources, watch out for it!

If you are a welsh primary school teacher and have any queries about using the LCOGT On Sky interface contact the Universe in the Classroom project coordinator at [unawe@astro.cf.ac.uk] (mailto:unawe@cardiff.cf.ac.uk)
