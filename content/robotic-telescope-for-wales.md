Universe in the Classroom have access to an exclusive programme using [Las Cumbres Observatory](http://lcogt.net), for use by Welsh school children.

A core aspect of Universe in the Classroom is to help Welsh students (and their teachers) enjoy and explore the vast Universe.

A range of astronomy activities have been designed based around the Robotic Telescope for Wales. The activities allows students to pursue their own science investigations using professional-quality equipment and cover a range of National Curriculum subjects to help teachers fit the activities and telescope into their lesson plans.
