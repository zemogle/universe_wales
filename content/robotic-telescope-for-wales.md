+++

Schools involved in Universe in the Classroom have access to an exclusive programme using [Las Cumbres Observatory](http://lcogt.net). A core aspect of Universe in the Classroom is to help Welsh students (and their teachers) enjoy and explore the vast Universe using this robotic telescope network.

## Activities

A range of astronomy activities have been designed based around the Robotic Telescope for Wales. The activities allows students to pursue their own science investigations using professional-quality equipment and cover a range of National Curriculum subjects to help teachers fit the activities and telescope into their lesson plans.

The robot behind Las Cumbres Observatory is called SEROL ("Starry" in Welsh). This character appears throughout all of the Universe in the Classroom resources. Watch out for it!

If you are a welsh primary school teacher and have any queries about using the LCOGT On Sky interface contact the Universe in the Classroom project coordinator at unawe@astro.cf.ac.uk
