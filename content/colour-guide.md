We’re all familiar with the breathtaking, colourful images of the cosmos captured by famous telescopes such as the Hubble Space Telescope, they’re used in magazines, on advertisements, album covers and T-shirts. However, these images, like all astronomical photographs, were originally collected in black and white. The colour images are created by combining three separate black and white images; one taken with a green filter, one with a blue filter and one with a red filter. Red, green and blue are three primary colours that can simulate a full spectrum of visible light to the human eye.

#### Instructions

1) To begin you’re going to need three images of your object; one taken with a red filter (R), one taken with a green filter (V) and one taken with a blue filter (B).

2) Go to your Observing Homepage at lco.global/observe and scroll down to find the images you want to use. Or choose three images from the vast LCO archive at lco.global/observations/

3) Right-click and open the three image as new tabs.

4) Beginning with the red filter image, you can now save the file as a JPEG by clicking ‘jpeg’ on the right side of the screen. Ensure you include the object name and filter in the file name so you can locate the file easily later on. Repeat for the blue and green image.

5) Open a new tab on your browser and go to [apps.pixlr.com/editor/](https://pixlr.com/editor/)
Note: This app is not suitable for tablets.

6) Select ‘Open image from computer’ and open your red filter image.

7) When your image is open the first thing we want to do is ensure the highest quality by maximising the levels. You only need to do this if you picture looks a little grey or blurred. Go to **Adjustment > Levels…**

8) The aim is to use the sliders to make the background sky as dark as possible without losing any of the detail from your image.

9) Make a note of the final numbers because you will need to make sure all your images have the same settings.

10) Next we get to colour our first image! Go to **Adjustment > Hue & Saturation**

11) Use the table below to find the **Hue** you’ll enter here for each image.

12) When you’ve added the **Hue** tick the ‘colorize' box to check you have the correct colour.

13) You can probably keep the **Saturation** and **Lightness** values at 0, but feel free to play around with these. Again, make sure that the background sky is kept as dark as possible and note down these values as you will need to use the same values for the blue and green images.

14) When you’re happy click **OK**.

15) Go to **Layer > Open image as layer** and open the green filter image.

16) Now we want to follow the same steps for the green and blue images, using the Hue values shown in the previous table. Once you have completed all three layers, you are almost finished!

17) You will see a layers box to the right of the page. Click to select the blue layer.

18) Select the slider option ![Scrn 9](/images/colourguide9.png)

19) An option to alter the Opacity and Mode will now appear. Change the **Mode** to **‘Screen’**.

20) Select the green layer and repeat. You should now have a full-colour image!

21) You may have to make a couple of final adjustments for a perfect image, however. If your images are slightly misaligned this can be fixed by simply selecting ![Scrn 8](/images/colourguide8.png)

![Scrn 6](/images/colourguide6.png)

22) This option allows you to move one layer at a time. Make sure you un-tick the box on the layer you are not working with (in the ‘Layers’ box to the right), this will make that layer temporarily invisible.

23) Now click on the image and use your arrow keys to move the layer until it aligns as well as possible with the layer below. Zoom in using ![Scrn 7](/images/colourguide7.png) for a more accurate result.

24) Now repeat this process on the other layer.

25) Once your layers are aligned set them all to visible. You should now have a stunning full-colour image of one of the wonders of the cosmos!

#### Congratulations, you just created your first beautiful coloured image of the cosmos!
