##How to Use the Robotic Telescopes

Distant stars and galaxies are much too far away for us to reach, everything we know about distant stars and galaxies comes from looking at the light they produce. Telescopes are the only real instruments we have to explore the Universe.

The Las Cumbres Observatory [https://lco.global/](https://lco.global/) is offering a unique opportunity to take students on an unforgettable journey through the cosmos. 

With a computer and Internet connection, you can access and control professional telescopes to take breath-taking images of the night sky without leaving your classroom. 

Below is a step-by-step guide to walk you through your first observing session using the LCO robotic telescopes. 

####Walkthrough

1.	Begin by opening your browser of choice and going to [https://observe.lco.global](https://observe.lco.global) 

2.	Enter your login details as requested to access the observing platform. The first page you are directed to upon logging is your Observation Homepage. On this page you will see any previous observations.

3.	Select Submit Observations. You’ll be taken to a page displaying an observation request form. Complete the form to submit your observation request using the guide below.

**Title**: Begin your request by selecting a title. The title acts as a personal reference, so chose a name that you’ll remember easily in future. 

**Proposal**: Select the proposal for which you are making the request from the drop-down menu. 

**Instrument**: From the drop-down menu select a telescope class for which you’ve been allocated time: 2m telescopes (Spectral camera), 1m telescopes (Sinistro camera) or 0.4m telescopes (SBIG camera).

**Target Name**: Submit the name of your target object. If you choose well-known target name the sidereal coordinates will be automatically entered into the Right Ascension and Declination fields.

**Filter**: Select a filter from the drop-down menu: a red filter (R), green filter (V) or blue filter. To create a full-colour astronomical image, you’ll need an observation made with each of the three filters (BVR). Duplicate the ‘Configuration’ field by clicking ![valhalla-scrn2](/images/valhalla-scrn2.png) until you have an exposure with each filter.

**Exposure Count**: Select the number of exposures to be made with the selected filter. 

**Exposure Time**: The exposure time is how long the shutters will stay open, in seconds. The dimmer the object, the longer the exposure time needed to capture a decent image.

**Start (UT)**: The final section of the form described the time window within which the observation should be made. Enter the date at which the observing window opens from the pop-up calendar, then the hour, minute and second from the pop-up timer. 

**End (UT)**: Use the pop-up menus to enter the time are which your observing window closes.
