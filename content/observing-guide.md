To use the robotic telescopes, you will need an LCOGT On Sky account (On Sky is the name of the observing website). By now, you should have received an email with your account details. If you are a Welsh primary school educator and do no yet have access to the network, or if you have any issues accessing your account, contact the Universe in the Classroom project coordinator at unawe@astro.cf.ac.uk

Before beginning, you must decide whether you want to submit your observation requests to a queue or whether you want to carry out your observations in real time. For the second option you will need to contact the project coordinator at least a couple of days in advance and they will reserve the telescope for the time and duration you require. Please do not hesitate to request a slot, just send the time, date and duration to unawe@astro.cf.ac.uk

### Instructions

1) Open your browser and go to [lcogt.net/observe/](http://lcogt.net/observe/)

2) Enter your **login details** as requested to access On Sky.

The first page you are directed to after logging in to On Sky is your Observation Homepage. On this page you will see your project, Universe in the Classroom, and your available telescope time (quota) in minutes. 

**Note: If you run out of observing credit, just contact your project coordinator to request more, at [unawe@astro.cf.ac.uk](unawe@astro.cf.ac.uk)**

3) Select **‘Book a Slot’** or **‘Request Observations’**. The ‘Book a Slot’ option is only relevant if you have contacted your Project Coordinator to reserve a specific time for your observations. If you have not booked a slot, skip to step 6.

**Note: You must submit your observation requests at least one hour before your slot is due to begin.**

4) To schedule observations during your slot, return to your Homepage and scroll down to the section ‘Upcoming Slots’. Simply click the relevant time slot and skip to Step 7.

###### LCOGT Scheduler
 
All telescopes in the LCOGT network can be scheduled as a single global entity. Although requests are made for a specific telescope class, you won’t be able to identify specific sites or telescopes. (Don’t worry, all 1-meter telescopes are identical). Instead, each observation will be scheduled on the best telescope available, and in the event of a failure due to weather or technical problems, your observation will be rebooked on the next available telescope.

SEROL automatically considers all observing constraints -- such as when your target object can be observed and from which sites and the brightness of the Moon -- so you don’t have to worry about anything!

5) To request observations without a scheduled slot, begin by selecting the time period within which you need your images from the options on the left-hand; side of the page: ‘24-hours’, ‘1 week’ or ‘2 weeks’.

###### Time Windows

The Time Window is the amount of time during which the target is eligible for observation. For example, if you select a Time Window of one week your observation will be scheduled within the next week, or not at all.

6) On the next page enter a request title at the top of the page and select the option ‘Add an Observation’. You will see a pop up box as shown on the image below. 

Don’t be intimidated by the number of parameters on this page, if you don’t have a specific observational target in mind or would like to avoid having to choose filters and exposure times, you can simply select an object from the list on the right. 

The list includes a number of stunning astronomical targets, categorised by object type: Galaxy, Star Cluster and Nebulae.

7) Select the object you would like to observe by clicking on its name from the list and pressing ‘Add’. Skip to step 14.

8) If you would like to be adventurous and try to observe a target that is not listed, enter the name or coordinates into the relevant field.

9) The next step is to select which filters you would like to use (like those on a camera). The system is automatically set to capture three images, one with a red filter (R), one with a green filter (V) and one with a blue filter (B). But you can select from a list of other filters.

10) Now select an exposure time, this is how long the shutters will stay open. The dimmer the object, the longer the exposure time needed to capture a decent image.

11) The last field asks how many of each image you would like (remember that you have limited observing time!).

###### Las Cumbres Observatory Global Telescope Network

 The Las Cumbres Observatory Global Telescope (LCOGT) Network is made up of 11 telescopes located at 7 of the best observing sites around the world. The telescopes can be controlled robotically from anywhere in the world!

13) Once you have completed the form, click Add. 

14) To observe more than one object, select Add Extra Target and complete the previous steps for your new target. Note that one observation request should last no longer than 30 minutes. You can see the duration of your request at the top of the page.

15) Once you have added all the targets you wish to observe, check there are no problems with your observations. If your targets have a green tick on them, you are good to go. If there is a red symbol this means there is a problem. Hover over it to find out what the problem is and resolve it. You may need to choose a new target. 

16) When you’re finally ready to submit your observation request, it’s as easy as clicking Submit at the top of the page. 

You will then be taken to your Submitted page, where you will find a list of all your observation requests and the status of each observation, including whether the request was cancelled or completed, and if the observation is pending or was for some reason unschedulable.


Blue   =  Submitted but pending.

Green =  Successful. Your images 		    are waiting.

Red    =  Observations failed.

Black  =  Observations were 		    cancelled by you or an administrator.

17) After submitting an observation request using a pre-booked time slot, you can watch all of your observations happening in real-time. Just click on the your request from the Submitted page prior to or during the time window of your slot.
 
Unfortunately, you won’t be able to see through the eyepiece of the telescope, but you can watch as the telescope slews to your object via an on-site webcam while watching the progress of your observations.This page also provides a virtual view of the night sky showing the location of your target object(s)!

18) When your observations are completed you can access the images by returning to your Observation Homepage. Then, just scroll down to ‘Your Recent Observations’ and click on the image you want to see.

#### Well done on completing an astronomical observing session!
