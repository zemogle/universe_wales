[Cardiff School of Physics and Astronomy](http://www.astro.cf.ac.uk) is reaching out to primary schools and communities across Wales, hoping to spark a curiosity about the Universe in young children.

Universe in the Classroom is an initiative that provides improved teaching methods and innovative tools to modernise and enhance the way STEMM subjects (science, technology, engineering, medicine and mathematics) are taught to young children. As well as inspirational school workshops, the programme offers STEMM teacher training to Welsh primary school teachers to ensure have the confidence and knowledge to use the new resources, which includes a programme of activities using robotic telescopes, Universe-in-a-Box educational toolkits and dozens of enquiry-based learning activities.

To carry out this ambitious project, which plans to reach 60,000 children over a decade, Universe in the Classroom has recruited a diverse team of enthusiastic science undergraduates and postgraduates from Cardiff University to act as Stellar Role Models (STARS) and demonstrate to the next generation that science is for everyone. These volunteers have already organised and hosted dozens of astronomy workshops for children and are now putting emphasis on exploring the cosmos in classrooms with the Las Cumbres Observatory robotic telescope network.
