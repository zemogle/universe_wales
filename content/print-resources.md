#### Telescope in your Pocket activity book

This activity book includes all range of fun astronomy activities based on the exciting topics of robotic telescopes and exotic astronomical objects. Students are invited to learn how telescopes work, design a comic that takes them on a trip to outer space and play a game of galactic spot-the-difference.

#### There’s No Such Thing as a Stupid Question comic book

This comic aims to empower kids to see themselves as scientists, and the key to making that happen is to encourage them to ask questions. The idea behind this comic is to show children that questions which seem like they might be 'stupid' can lead to real scientific discoveries, and are not stupid at all!

#### Build Your Own 0.4-metre Telescope

Access to LCOGT’s robotic telescope network means that children in welsh primary schools can explore the wonders of the night sky during the school day without the need for an expensive school trip. However, the distance means the kids never get to experience the physical appearance of the telescopes - that’s where this 6cm model of LCOGTs 1-metre telescopes comes in. Children can print and build their own model telescope before or after carry out an observing session on a real-life version of this astronomical instrument.

#### Build Your Own Serol

The robot behind Las Cumbres Observatory is called SEROL ("Starry" in Welsh). SEROL controls the telescopes, you simply tell it what you'd like to observe and he will do all the hard work for you. SEROL helps children grasp the concept of the LCO scheduler, responsible for assigning observation requests to suitable telescopes across the network. With this model, children can print and build their own cute Serol robot, before asking Serol to schedule an observation on the LCO robotic telescope network.
