To the human eye much of the light in the Universe is invisible; at either end of the rainbow there is light we can't see. Below the red end is near Infrared, Microwave and Radio light and above the violet end of the rainbow is near ultraviolet, X-ray and Gamma ray. To fully explore cosmic phenomena, astronomers must observe the Universe in all light.

In this activity students will explore invisible light using household objects. They will learn about the uses of different types of light before carrying out an observing session with the robotic telescopes that will allow them to compare views of the Universe in visible and invisible light.

#### Background Science

Visible light is a kind of electromagnetic wave, these are a form of energy wave that has both an electric and magnetic field. Other types of electromagnetic wave (light) are classified by their frequency. From lowest to highest frequency these are: Radio, Microwave, Infrared, Ultraviolet, X-ray, Gamma ray, with visible light in the middle.

**Radio**: Radio waves have the longest wavelength, ranging from a few centimetres to a few kilometres. Radio waves are widely used to transmit information, for example: radio, satellites, radar and computer networks. 

**Microwave**: Microwaves are slightly shorter than radio waves, they are measured in centimetres. Microwaves are used to heat food, transmit information and even predict the weather.

**Infrared**: Anything that gives off heat emits Infrared waves, including humans. Infrared is used in remote controls. 

**Ultraviolet**: Ultraviolet from the Sun causes our skin to tan or burn. Luckily the Earth’s ozone layer protects us from most of the harmful ultraviolet light from the Sun.

**X-ray**: X-rays have even shorter wavelengths than ultraviolet waves. X-ray light can travel through soft tissue which is why we use it to take pictures of our bones. 

**Gamma ray**: Gamma rays have the shortest wavelength of all types of light, this means they also have the most energy. Gamma rays are emitted by some of the most violent events in nature, such as nuclear explosions and supernovae.

#### Step-by-Step

1) Give each student an Invisible Light worksheet (Appendix 6) to refer to during the demonstration.

2) Begin by asking the students how they think a remote works. Explain that the remote interacts with the device (TV, projector etc) through a type of light called infrared.

3) With the remote’s LED visible to the class, press a button on their remote. Do they see a beam of light? Why not? Is the remote not working?

4) Press a button on the remote again, but this time look at the LED through the camera. Note: ensure as many students as possible can see the camera screen. You can also pass the props around for students to explore after the demonstration.

5) What do the students notice this time? The remote is working and it is emitting light. However, the human eye can’t detect this type of light. It is infrared light.

6) Can they name any other types of light that cannot be seen by the naked eye. Write their answers on the board until you have all types of light. You can give them a few clues: Have they ever broken a bone? Have they ever reheated their dinner? Do they listen to music in the car?

  - Radio
  - Microwave
  - Ultraviolet
  - Infrared
  - X-rays 
  - Gamma Rays	

7) You can explain that the Sun gives off all types of light, some that we can see and some that we can’t — and so do all other stars. By looking at the Universe with X-ray, infrared, radio telescopes etc. we can see all kinds of objects that are not visible to the human eye. 

8) Split the class into groups of three or four. Give each student an Invisible Light worksheet (Appendix 6) and a tablet. Ask them to complete their worksheets as a group.

**Note: Students should be assured not to worry if the images on the website have thin lines on them, this is a simple case of dead pixels on the telescope and is unavoidable.**

###### Answer Table

Target | Visible Light | Invisible Light | Both
--- | --- | --- | ---
| Cigar Galaxy | More stars visible | X-ray shows plumes of hot material shooting from the centre. | Main galaxy disc seen side-on
| Antennae Galaxy | Bright patches of stars see within the galaxy | Extended halo of material around the galaxies| Shape of merging galaxies
| Crab Nebula | Ejected star material: shell of cosmic gas and dust | Spinning x-ray disc around central neutron star (core of exploded star) | Shell of ejected material 
| Centaurus A | Able to see disc of the galaxy | Huge jets extending from an invisible black hole at the centre of the galaxy. Jets protruding at a right angle to the galaxy disc. | Nothing
| Eagle Nebula | Clearer, stars brighter and contrast starker | Extra stars seen in microwave, including stars hidden within the dust columns | Stars and clouds of gas and dust

#### Conclusion

Finish the activity by taking your own image of at least one of the objects from the worksheet using the robotic telescopes: Antennae galaxies, Orion Nebula, Cigar Galaxy, Crab Nebula, Triangulum Galaxy.
