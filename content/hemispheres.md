Around 9000 stars are bright enough to be visible to the naked eye, but even in the most perfect observing site imaginable we can only see half of them at once. This is because the planet will always obscure some of the night sky from our view. This activity will explain this complex idea with a simple hands-on demonstration, while also explaining the important concepts of the Equator and the Hemispheres.

#### Learning Objectives

- Identify the position and significance of the *Equator, Northern Hemisphere* and *Southern Hemisphere*.
- Become familiar with the rotation of the Earth, including the axial tilt.
- Understand that we can only see half the celestial hemisphere from any one location.
- Understand why it is important to have telescopes located in both hemispheres.

#### Materials

- Printed [Astronomical Images](Appendix 13)
- Printed [Figurines](Appendix 17)
- Globe or Earth Ball
- Adhesive putty (such as Blue tack)
- String (long enough to wrap around Globe/ Earth Ball)
- x7 small stickers

#### Background Science

The Earth is a sphere. An invisible line drawn around the Earth called the Equator splits it into two halves, these halves are known as Hemispheres. To the north of the equator is the Northern Hemisphere; to the south of the equator is the Southern Hemisphere.

The Northern Hemisphere includes all of Europe, North America, the northern parts of South America, two-thirds of Africa and almost all of Asia.The Southern Hemisphere includes Australasia, Antarctica, most of South America, one-third of Africa and a tiny bit of Asia. The image and table below show the location of the seven main LCOGT observing sites.

| Observatory    | Location          |
|:---------------|:------------------|
| Haleakala      | Hawaii, USA       |
| McDonald       | Texas, USA        |
| Cerro Tololo   | Chile             |

#### Step-by-Step

#####Preparation*

1) Before beginning this activity, print out Astronomical Images and Figurines.

2) Cut out the two astronomical images and two of the figurines.

3) You should have two pictures of the night sky: one of the North Star and one of the Andromeda Galaxy (Appendix 13). Using adhesive putty stick the North Star high on a wall. Stick the Andromeda Galaxy low down on the opposite wall.

4) Place your 7 stickers on your globe, each one will mark the location of an LCOGT observatory. Find the locations on the image and table in the Background Information section.

#####Instructions

1) Check the students understand how the Earth rotates; demonstrate the rotation of the Earth using your globe or Earth Ball and make sure to include the Earth’s axial tilt  (23.4°) . Note: The Earth rotates in an anti-clockwise direction.

2) Ask the students if they have ever heard of the North Star:
  - Where do we see the North Star? (**Directly above the North Pole**).
  - Does the North Star ever move away from the North Pole (e.g. when the Earth rotates)? (**No**).

3) Ask a volunteer to simulate a day on Earth using the globe/ Earth Ball. Make sure they keep the Earth tilted and the North Pole pointed at your picture of the North Star.

4) Once they understand the way the Earth moves in relation to the North Star, ask the students how many sides the Earth has. Of course, the Earth is a sphere so it has just one side. However, explain that we do split the surface into two halves called Hemispheres.

5) Ask a volunteer to help wrap the string around the centre of the globe to denote the equator (see image below). Write the following terms on the board to help your students remember: Equator, Hemispheres, Northern Hemisphere, Southern Hemisphere.

6) Point to each of the following on the globe in turn,  
  - Explain what the Equator is to the class.
  - Explain that we call the two regions above and below the equator the Hemispheres.
  - Explain that the half of the globe to the north of the equator is called the Northern Hemisphere and the half of the globe to the south of the equator is called the Southern Hemisphere.

7) Now, attach two figurines to your globe with blue tac; place one standing close to the North Pole (e.g. in Greenland or Finland) and one close to the South Pole (e.g in Chile or Australia).

8) Ask a volunteer to again simulate the rotation of the Earth (mindful of the axial tilt and position of the North Star). Ask them to repeat this a few more times with the other students watching the images of Andromeda and the North Star carefully:
  a. Did the class notice anything? At what time of day could the figurine in the Northern Hemisphere see the image of Andromeda? (Never).

  b. At what time could the figurine in the Southern Hemisphere see the North Star? (Never).

9) The students should realise that the figure based in the Northern Hemisphere is never be able to view Andromeda, this can only be seen by the figurine in the Southern Hemisphere, and vice versa.

10) Although some night sky objects that can be seen from both hemispheres, there are many that can only be seen from one hemisphere, this is why LCOGT has telescopes all over the world, so they can see every bit of the night sky! Point to the different observatories on your globe to demonstrate the locations on both hemispheres.

#### Conclusion

By the end of this activity students should understand that the Earth has two Hemispheres and why we need observatories in both the Southern and Northern Hemispheres. Now choose two astronomical objects from the list below; one that is visible from the northern half of the night sky and one from the southern half. Request observations of both images using the robotic telescopes and see the benefits of a world-wide robotic telescope network first hand!

Below are a few examples of northern and southern astronomical objects you could observe.
