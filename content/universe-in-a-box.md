Universe-in-a-Box is an educational kit designed by the [Universe Awareness](http://www.unawe.org) project to assist educators in bringing astronomy and space sciences to 4–11 year old children. The toolkit was developed in response to a demand for practical, interactive and fun resources for bringing astronomy into the classroom. 

In 2014, *Universe in the Classroom* handed 100 free Universe-in-a-Box toolkits to selected primary schools across Wales, providing teachers and educators with over 40 practical activities, as well as the materials and models required to do them.

The comprehensive activity book includes all necessary background information, “how-to” steps, guidance on further experimentation and craft templates to cover five modules in the classrom: 
 
- Our Fascinating Moon, 
- The Earth: Our Home Planet, 
- The Sun: Our Home Star, 
- Our Solar System, 
- The World of Constellations.
